    Planning
    Practice
    Created:
        penguni_graph_expiriments.py
        analysis.py
        calc_total_populations()
25 mins
    Studied matplotlib documentation - quicstart guide
    practiced matplotlib

25 mins
    continued matplotlib study and practice
    created:
        matplotlib_practice.py
        graph_populations() - maybe make nested func of calc_total_populations?

35 minutes
    Figures out how to get the average (median) lengths of flippers for each species - filter and aggregate

25 minutes
    Practiced dataframe.filter function and started practicing dataframe.loc function


11/20/23
25 minutes
    review/warmup
    Looked for bill length and depth correlations using the scatter plots from matplotlib for practice
    worked on filtering out penguins with longer than average
    Question - should average flipper length be calculated using measurement from outside sources?
25 Minutes
    Studied pandas documentation

25 minutes
    studied sorting pandas dataframes
    renamed pd_dataframe_graphing_practice.py to pd_dataframe_practice.py
    sorting practice and numpy rand side track

25 minutes
    sorting practice
    I think maybe I should watch a tutorial

10 minutes
    penguin sorting expiriments

Current total:
8.4 hours

11/22/23

25 minutes
    Changed question 1 from "1. On which of the three islands (Dream, Biscoe, and Torgenson) were penguins with long flippers
    (greater than the average length for the species - chinstrap, gentoo, and adelie) most common?"

    to
    "1. On which of the three islands (Dream, Biscoe, and Torgenson) were Adelie penguins with long flippers
    (greater than the average length for the species) most common?"

    as gentoo penguins are only found on Biscoe, and chinstraps only on Dream

    Planning, graphin expiriments

25 minutes
    figured out how to create and lable bar graph displaying total number of penguins with long flippers for each island - _graph_long_flipper_adelies_pops
    code refactor for calc_population_totals() and graph_populations()

34 Minutes
    Worked on _graph_adelies_per_island()
27 minutes
    Worked on annotating _graph_adelies_per_island()

Split population graphs into two

25 minutes
    Reworked graph_total_populations() to give seperate bar graphs for species and island - Mom's suggestion
    Added colors to graphs
    Started planning question 2, slight rework

50 minutes
