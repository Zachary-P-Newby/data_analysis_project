# Overview

This is a personal Python project, the goal of which is to gain expirence in data analysis and visualization using the pandas and matplotlib libraries. Since data science is a large and profitable field programmers work in, it makes sense for an apsiring programmer such as myself to gain expirence in it to increase my skill set and open up new career opportunities.

The Dataset is the [Palmer Penguin Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashkhagan/palmer-penguins-datasetalternative-iris-dataset/) from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com), it was compiled from research on penguins by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station and uploaded to Kaggle by [Ashwani Rathee]((which was compiled from research on penguins by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station and uploaded to Kaggle by Ashwani Rathee for data visualization and exploration) ) for data visualization and exploration purposes. It consists of the basic characteristics studied by Dr. Gorman, consisting of species, the island they were found on, bill length (mm), bill depth(mm), flipper length(mm), body mass (g), and sex.


The purpose of this program is to answer these two questions and visulaize the associated data:

1. On which of the three islands (Dream, Biscoe, and Torgenson) were penguins with long flippers greater than the average length for the species (chinstrap, gentoo, and adelie) most common?

2. Is there a correlation between penguin bill length and depth? And if so, what species and island had the penguins with the largest bills? (Bills that are both deep and long)

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Data Analysis Results

{List the questions and the answers you found by doing this analysis.}

# Development Environment

For my development enviorment I used Microsoft Vscode

This program was created in the python programming language, and uses the pandas and matplotllib libraries
